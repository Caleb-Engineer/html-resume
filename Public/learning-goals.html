<h1>Learning Goals</h1>
<p>
  Here are some of the skills that I plan on learning in the near and distant
  future!
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hebrew</li>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>iOS</li>
  <li>Swift</li>
  <li>The Piano</li>
  <li>Book Writing</li>
  <li>Video Game Design</li>
  <li>CyberSecurity</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Some of these goals will definitely be met in the very near future. Some of
  the other goals are more long-term focused. Whether or not I will accomplish
  all of these goals in the next couple years, only time will tell, however I
  have made it my aim to enjoy the journey!
